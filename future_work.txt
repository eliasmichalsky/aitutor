Great question — and very relevant for your evaluation and future work section!

Since your current system already uses symbolic (graph-based) retrieval (via Neo4j) and web-based full-text search (via Tavily), here are a few realistic upgrades that would make your system stronger and more flexible:

🔧 Recommended Retrieval Methods to Add (or Consider):
✅ 1. Semantic Vector Retrieval (Embedding Search)
Why?
Symbolic (graph-based) retrieval is powerful when your data is structured, but it fails if the query doesn’t match a known node name or misses fuzzy language. Embedding search allows you to retrieve semantically similar content, even when the wording is different.

How?
Use tools like:

Chroma, FAISS, or Weaviate as a vector store

OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings for text encoding

Benefit to your project:
More flexible and robust responses when the knowledge graph has gaps.

✅ 2. Hybrid Retrieval (Symbolic + Semantic Combined)
Why?
You can combine Neo4j with vector search: first filter relevant node types with Cypher, then rerank or expand with embeddings. This gives structured precision and fuzzy flexibility together.

How?

First run a Cypher query for node candidates

Then embed the results and compare them to the user’s query vector

Benefit:
The best of both worlds — precise, interpretable answers and coverage of loosely phrased queries.

✅ 3. Memory-Based Context Retrieval
Why?
To help the AI remember the user’s learning history, past questions, or previous mistakes.

How?

Use LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory or SummaryMemory

Store user responses and system feedback per session

Benefit:
Would directly support Research Question 3 — making the tutor adapt to the learner’s knowledge level.

⚠️ Optional Advanced Ideas (for future work):
Chain-of-Thought Retrieval (like Sanmartin’s Chain of Exploration) → for reasoning paths in knowledge graphs

Rule-based retrieval → if you need strict, predefined responses (e.g., for safety)

📌 Suggested Plan:
If you want a strong improvement without over-complicating things, the best one to add now would be:

Semantic Retrieval with Vector Embeddings
You can use it alongside your current Neo4j setup and even compare which gives better results.
